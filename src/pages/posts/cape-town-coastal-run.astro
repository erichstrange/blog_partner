  <h2>The Sea Point Promenade</h2>
  <p>
    My journey began at sunrise on the famous Sea Point Promenade. This flat, paved pathway stretches for kilometers along the Atlantic Ocean, offering stunning views of the sea on one side and Lion's Head on the other. It's a popular spot for both locals and visitors, especially during the golden hours.
  </p>

  <h2>Coastal Trails</h2>
  <p>
    The real adventure begins when you venture onto the coastal trails. From Camps Bay to Llandudno, these paths offer challenging terrain and breathtaking ocean views. The sound of crashing waves and the fresh sea breeze create a perfect running atmosphere.

  <h2>Notable Routes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sea Point Promenade to Camps Bay (10km return)</li>
    <li>Chapman's Peak Drive (challenging elevation)</li>
    <li>Noordhoek Beach Run (7km of pristine beach)</li>

  <h2>Wildlife Encounters</h2>
  <p>
    One of the unique aspects of running in Cape Town is the possibility of wildlife encounters. From dolphins playing in the waves to African penguins at Boulders Beach, there's always something exciting to see.

  <h2>Best Running Times</h2>
  <p>
    Early morning runs are ideal, especially in summer. The famous Cape Town wind tends to pick up later in the day, and the morning light creates perfect conditions for both running and photography.
