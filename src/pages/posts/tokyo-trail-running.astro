    When you think of Tokyo, images of neon lights, crowded streets, and towering skyscrapers probably come to mind. But beneath this ultra-modern facade lies a network of hidden trails and green spaces perfect for urban trail running.
  </p>

  <h2>Discovering Hidden Trails</h2>
  <p>
    My journey began in the early hours of a crisp spring morning, starting from the peaceful Meiji Shrine grounds. As the city slowly awakened, I found myself traversing a network of interconnected parks and elevated paths that offered a unique perspective on Tokyo's urban landscape.
  </p>

  <h2>Urban Meets Nature</h2>
  <p>
    The beauty of Tokyo's urban trails lies in their contrast - one moment you're running through a serene bamboo grove, the next you're crossing a modern pedestrian bridge with views of the city skyline. These transitions create a running experience unlike anywhere else in the world.
  </p>

  <h2>Notable Routes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Imperial Palace Loop - A classic 5km circuit</li>
    <li>Mount Takao Trails - Natural trails just an hour from the city</li>
    <li>Tamagawa River Path - Miles of uninterrupted riverside running</li>
    <li>Shinjuku Gyoen to Yoyogi Park Connection</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Best Times to Run</h2>
  <p>
    Early morning runs offer the most peaceful experience, especially during weekdays. The trails are quieter, and you'll often encounter other runners and local exercise groups. Plus, the morning light creates stunning photo opportunities.

  <h2>Tips for Urban Trail Running in Tokyo</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Carry a water bottle - vending machines are common but not always on trails</li>
    <li>Download offline maps - some trail entrances can be tricky to find</li>
    <li>Learn basic Japanese running etiquette</li>
    <li>Pack a light rain shell - weather can change quickly</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Tokyo proves that urban trail running can be just as rewarding as traditional trail experiences. The city's unique blend of nature and urban infrastructure creates running opportunities that challenge both body and mind while offering a fresh perspective on one of the world's most fascinating cities.
